Itâ€™s only a thought, and a thought can be changed.

As I say yes to life, life says yes to me.

I come from the loving space of my heart, and I know that love opens all doors.

Deep at the center of my being is an infinite well of love.

You're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.
